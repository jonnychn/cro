# CRO Calculator

This repository provides a simple single page calculator for modeling conversion-based revenue.

Open `index.html` in your browser and adjust the sliders for advertising spend, visitors, conversion rate, monthly price, retention, and profit margin. The results update automatically in the table on the right and show:

- Number of paying customers
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Annual recurring revenue (ARR)
- Monthly and annual advertising spend
- Payback period based on your advertising spend
- Monthly and annual profit

Use it to experiment with different marketing assumptions.
