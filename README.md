# CRO Calculator

This repository provides a simple single page calculator for modeling conversion-based revenue.

Open `index.html` in your browser and adjust the sliders for visitors, conversion rate, monthly price, retention, and cost per visitor. The results update automatically and show:

- Number of paying customers
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Annual recurring revenue (ARR)
- Payback period based on acquisition cost

Use it to experiment with different marketing assumptions.
